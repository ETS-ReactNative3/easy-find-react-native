### Installation

 - Open  [public repository][git]
 - Here you can clone or download project

### Tech

EasyFind uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [React-Native] - React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities. An incomplete port for Qt also exists.
* [Yelp API] - The Yelp Fusion API allows you to get the best local content and user reviews from millions of businesses across 32 countries. This tutorial provides an overview of the capabilities our suite of APIs offer, provides instructions for how to authenticate API calls, and walks through a simple scenario using the API.

And of course EasyFind itself is open source with a [public repository][git] on GitHub.

### Libraries
